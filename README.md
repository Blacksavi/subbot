## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: If not already installed, install it from [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-translation-bot.git
   cd telegram-translation-bot

	2.	Install dependencies:
This project requires several Node.js packages to work correctly. Run the following command to install them:

npm install


	3.	Configure the Bot:
Create a file named config.js in the root directory of the project and paste the following code:

// config.js
module.exports = {
  token: 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE',  // Replace with your bot token
};


	4.	Update Word Mappings:
	‚Ä¢	Open the badword.js file to add your custom bad words and their Sinhala replacements:

module.exports = {
  "fuck": "‡∑Ñ‡∑î‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∂≠",
  "slut": "‡∑Ä‡∑ö‡∑É‡∑í",
  "bitch": "‡∂∂‡∑ê‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∂Ω‡∑í",
  "dick": "‡∂¥‡∂∫‡∑í‡∂∫",
  // Add more bad words here
};


	‚Ä¢	Open the normalword.js file to add normal words and their Sinhala translations:

module.exports = {
  "hello": "‡∂Ü‡∂∫‡∑î‡∂∂‡∑ù‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ä",
  "good": "‡∑Ñ‡∑ú‡∂≥",
  "please": "‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∑î‡∂´‡∑è‡∂ö‡∂ª",
  // Add more normal words here
};



Bot Usage

Once everything is set up, you can start using the bot:
	1.	Run the bot:
In the project folder, run the following command:

node bot.js


	2.	How to use the bot:
	‚Ä¢	Open Telegram and search for your bot.
	‚Ä¢	Start the conversation by typing /start.
	‚Ä¢	Upload a .srt subtitle file.
	‚Ä¢	The bot will process the file and send back a translated .srt file in Sinhala.
The bot will automatically replace bad words based on your badword.js file and translate other text using Google Translate.

Running the Bot on VPS

You can run this bot on a VPS to keep it active 24/7. Here are the steps to do that:

Steps to Deploy on VPS
	1.	Set up a VPS:
	‚Ä¢	Choose a VPS provider like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Linode.
	‚Ä¢	Once you have the VPS, SSH into it:

ssh root@your_vps_ip


	2.	Install Node.js:
On the VPS, run the following commands to install Node.js:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm


	3.	Clone the repository on the VPS:
Navigate to your desired directory and clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-translation-bot.git
cd telegram-translation-bot


	4.	Install the dependencies:
Install all required Node.js dependencies:

npm install


	5.	Create the config.js file:
Follow the same steps as in the local setup to add your bot‚Äôs token and configure the bot.
	6.	Run the bot:
Start the bot using the following command:

node bot.js

Your bot will now be running on your VPS, and you can interact with it from Telegram.

Running the Bot as a Background Process (Optional)

To keep the bot running even after logging out of the VPS, you can use pm2:
	1.	Install pm2:

sudo npm install pm2 -g
